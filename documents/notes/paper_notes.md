# Paper Notes

### The Origins of Parasitism in the Platyhelminthes: a Summary Interpreted on the Basis of Recent Literature - Rohde 1997

### The evolution of parasitism in Nematoda - Blaxter 2014

### Synthesis of phylogeny and taxonomy into a comprehensive tree of life - Hinchliff 2015
- when phylogenetic data is missing, taxonomy was used
- first tree that is trying it
- We therefore assembled a comprehensive global reference taxonomy via alignment and merging of multiple openly available taxonomic resources. The Open Tree Taxonomy (OTT) is open, extensible, and updatable, and reflects the overall phylogeny of life
- prefer taxonomies that matches the available phylogeny
- Phylogenies: 6,810 trees from 3,062
- Taxonomy: Fungorum + SILVA + NCBI + GBIF + IRMNG


### Global biotic interactions: An open infrastructure to share and analyze species-interaction datasets - Poelen 2014
- predictions of factors will impact an ecosystem
- "In our model, an interaction observation is figured as a specimen (or occurrence) that interacts with another specimen, using interaction terms from the OBO Relations Ontology (Smith et al., 2005)."
- extraordinary komplex datacomposition process
- "Spatial, temporal, and taxonomic coverage of the combined datasets (Fig. 4, Tables 1, 2) shows that the aggregation of the described data sources covers about 50,000 taxa (or 8% of total number of ITIS taxa) in a period from 1897 until the present. This coverage is larger than any other single open aggregated species-interaction data collection that is available today simply because it aggregates many of the currently available, large, open datasets (Table 1)"
- GoMexSI and EOL integrated GLoBI
- other interaction services: Efforts such as Ecologists' Cooper- ative Web Bank (Cohen and Ecologists co-operative web bank (ecoweb), 2010), Webs on the Web (Yoon et al., 2004), Animal Diversity Web (Myers et al., 2014), and Interaction Web Database (Vázquez, 2005) ---- not active anymore, old data
- quality of datasets got better


### Diverse effects of parasites in ecosystems: linking interdependent processes - Hatcher 2012
- "Parasites and pathogens act as ecosys- tem engineers, alter energy budgets and nutrient cycling, and influence biodiversity"
- "Parasites affect the complexity of food webs and can influence how community composition responds to local species extinctions"
- trophic cascades etc.
- parasites restructure by killing invasive species
- effect of parasites on foodwebs (also with freeliving)
- most common consumer strategy of all (Lafferty et al. 2008!!!
- One reason for this is that interactions between hosts and parasites are often weak (compared to, for instance, predatory interactions), as effects on individual hosts are usually sublethal (Hatcher et al. 2006; Hatcher and Dunn 2011)
- p are changing energy budgets

### Homage to Linnaeus: How many parasites? How many hosts? - Dobsen 2008
- "75,000 and 300,000 helminth species parasitizing the vertebrates"
- "We estimate that between 3% and 5% of parasitic helminths are threatened with extinction in the next 50 to 100 years"
- "studies of food webs suggest that  75% of the links in food webs involve a parasitic species; these links are vital for regulation of host abundance and potentially for reducing the impact of toxic pollutants"
- parasitic worms were in paradoxa (linnaeus)
- a lot of invertebrates and protists are not classified because a little number of taxonoms are working on them
- 40% of all species are parasites and 60% are free-living: tested in salt marshes
- "Recent work by Sures (52, 59) and colleagues has shown that parasitic helminths may play a substantial role in concentrating and ultimately removing heavy metals and other pollutants from their hosts"
- 3% animal biomass -> 30-50% pollunt mass
- if parasite is lost, host is getting more pollunts
### Parasites in food webs: the ultimate missing links - Lafferty 2008


### Relations in biomedical ontologies - Smith 2005

### Gap Analysis of GloBI: Identifying Research and Data Sharing Opportunities for Species Interactions - Cains 2017
- linneus 1735 system naturae
- 7 shortfalls of biodiversity data
- interaction grouping
- discussion

### Kinetoplastid Phylogenomics Reveals the Evolutionary Innovations Associated with the Origins of Parasitism - Jackson 2016

### Multiple origins of parasitism in lice - Johnson 2004

### Preface: the evolution of parasite genomes and the origins of parasitism - Jackson 2014
- Hatcher 2012 "Ecosystem engineers"
- "considered parasitic adaptations less authentic than those of non- parasites."
- genome sequencing revolutionized the analysis
- apicomplexa single origin (rayner & keeling 2014)
- witness the routine use of Caenorhabditis elegans as a free-living comparator for all parasitic nematodes
- not only the parasitic genomes are missing, also the freeliving...
### Parasitism, the Diversity of Life, and Paleoparasitology - Araújo 2003

### Factors mediating plastid dependency and the origins of parasitism in apicomplexans and their close relatives - Janouškoveca 2014
- mostly off topic

### The Many Roads to Parasitism: A Tale of Convergence - Robert Poulin 2011

### Evolution of parasitism along convergent lines: from ecology to genomics - Robert Poulin 2013

### THE ORIGINS OF PARASITISM IN THE PROTISTS - J. R. Baker 1994

### EVOLUTION OF INSECT PARASITISM IN RHABDITID AND DIPLOGASTRID NEMATODES - Walter Sudhaus 2008

### THE ORIGINS OF PARASITISM IN THE PLATYHELMINTHES - Rohde 1994

### Independent origins of parasitism in Animalia - Weinstein 2016
- 223 origins in Metazoa/Animalia
- definition is important (pathogens are included!!)
- extensive literature search
- parasitism is not a dead end for evolution
- 3x loss

### Windsor 1998
- "Equal Rights for Parasites"
- "Parasites are the true engines of evolution!"
- "Toft estimates that 14.5% of eukaryotic species are parasites"
- "May in 1998 recognised that parasites account for about half of the species on Earth"
- "May in 1992 he offered a ratio of four parasites for every free!living host"
- We are losing species very fast: Sprent JFA Parasites lost1992;22:139-151
- "Every free!living species has parasites[ Any that are reputed not to have any have not been adequately studied["
