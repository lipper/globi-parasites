# Paper Notes

### The Origins of Parasitism in the Platyhelminthes: a Summary Interpreted on the Basis of Recent Literature - Rohde 1997
- Wie Plattwürmer Mechanismen entwickelt haben um den Host anzugreifen und das Immunsystem zu umgehen
- very low number of symbiosis, almost all are parasites mainly on vertebrates
- a lot of parasites are evolutionary trapped inside the ecological niche
- they evolve in a single lineage until they are trapped on the local optimum (host species)
- they can long jump to other hosts (other optima) only with increasing delays and ultimate stasis
- fitness landscape -> going up the hill and stay their
- P are not trapped permanentaly

### The evolution of parasitism in Nematoda - Blaxter 2014
- genomes of free-living organisms also need to get sequenced
- 1/3 to 1/4 of human population is right now infected with nematodes
- important regulators of plant and animal production
- to understand the origins is important for medical and veterinary science
- origin of nematoda was not a parasite
- "Independent origins of the parasitic habit can be validated by molecular phylogenetic placement of parasitic taxa and their free-living relatives (Blaxter et al. 1998; Dorris et al. 1999). With the current available molecular data we can define three origins of plant parasitism, 10 of parasitism of a wide range of non-vertebrates and five of parasitism of vertebrate hosts across the three subclasses (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Many additional events of acquisition of parasitic lifestyles could be proposed. For example, Sudhaus has suggested at least 20 independent events of acquisition of parasitism of insects in Nematoda (Sudhaus, 2008)."
- human parasites are overrepresented

### Synthesis of phylogeny and taxonomy into a comprehensive tree of life - Hinchliff 2015
- when phylogenetic data is missing, taxonomy was used
- first tree that is trying it
- We therefore assembled a comprehensive global reference taxonomy via alignment and merging of multiple openly available taxonomic resources. The Open Tree Taxonomy (OTT) is open, extensible, and updatable, and reflects the overall phylogeny of life
- prefer taxonomies that matches the available phylogeny
- Phylogenies: 6,810 trees from 3,062
- Taxonomy: Fungorum + SILVA + NCBI + GBIF + IRMNG


### Global biotic interactions: An open infrastructure to share and analyze species-interaction datasets - Poelen 2014
- predictions of factors will impact an ecosystem
- "In our model, an interaction observation is figured as a specimen (or occurrence) that interacts with another specimen, using interaction terms from the OBO Relations Ontology (Smith et al., 2005)."
- extraordinary komplex datacomposition process
- "Spatial, temporal, and taxonomic coverage of the combined datasets (Fig. 4, Tables 1, 2) shows that the aggregation of the described data sources covers about 50,000 taxa (or 8% of total number of ITIS taxa) in a period from 1897 until the present. This coverage is larger than any other single open aggregated species-interaction data collection that is available today simply because it aggregates many of the currently available, large, open datasets (Table 1)"
- GoMexSI and EOL integrated GLoBI
- other interaction services: Efforts such as Ecologists' Cooper- ative Web Bank (Cohen and Ecologists co-operative web bank (ecoweb), 2010), Webs on the Web (Yoon et al., 2004), Animal Diversity Web (Myers et al., 2014), and Interaction Web Database (Vázquez, 2005) ---- not active anymore, old data
- quality of datasets got better


### Diverse effects of parasites in ecosystems: linking interdependent processes - Hatcher 2012
- "Parasites and pathogens act as ecosys- tem engineers, alter energy budgets and nutrient cycling, and influence biodiversity"
- "Parasites affect the complexity of food webs and can influence how community composition responds to local species extinctions"
- trophic cascades etc.
- parasites restructure by killing invasive species
- effect of parasites on foodwebs (also with freeliving)
- most common consumer strategy of all (Lafferty et al. 2008!!!
- One reason for this is that interactions between hosts and parasites are often weak (compared to, for instance, predatory interactions), as effects on individual hosts are usually sublethal (Hatcher et al. 2006; Hatcher and Dunn 2011)
- p are changing energy budgets

### Homage to Linnaeus: How many parasites? How many hosts? - Dobsen 2008
- "75,000 and 300,000 helminth species parasitizing the vertebrates"
- "We estimate that between 3% and 5% of parasitic helminths are threatened with extinction in the next 50 to 100 years"
- "studies of food webs suggest that  75% of the links in food webs involve a parasitic species; these links are vital for regulation of host abundance and potentially for reducing the impact of toxic pollutants"
- parasitic worms were in paradoxa (linnaeus)
- a lot of invertebrates and protists are not classified because a little number of taxonoms are working on them
- 40% of all species are parasites and 60% are free-living: tested in salt marshes
- "Recent work by Sures (52, 59) and colleagues has shown that parasitic helminths may play a substantial role in concentrating and ultimately removing heavy metals and other pollutants from their hosts"
- 3% animal biomass -> 30-50% pollunt mass
- if parasite is lost, host is getting more pollunts

### Preface: the evolution of parasite genomes and the origins of parasitism - Jackson 2014
- Hatcher 2012 "Ecosystem engineers"
- "considered parasitic adaptations less authentic than those of non- parasites."
- genome sequencing revolutionized the analysis

### The Many Roads to Parasitism: A Tale of Convergence - Robert Poulin 2011

### Evolution of parasitism along convergent lines: from ecology to genomics - Robert Poulin 2013
- "eukaryotic parasite lineages have all converged toward only six general parasitic strategies: parasitoid, parasitic castrator, directly transmitted parasite, trophically transmitted parasite, vector-transmitted parasite or micropredator"
- some genetic parallelism in unrelated taxa when it comes to the question of the transit to parasitism
- maybe the most often life history strategy change in evolution!
- red algae 100 changes
- parasites are not morphologically simplified versions of free-living relatives
- eimeria = protist
- classification of parasites into 6 groups - as endpoints of ecvolution
- "Just as the evolution of parasitism appears inevi- table, having occurred repeatedly and independently in all major lineages of unicellular and multicellular organisms, their subsequent convergence toward one of the above strategies also seems inescapable (see Poulin, 2011, for further evidence and discussion)"
- scientists think, if a organism looses a morphological trait its genome is getting simpler
- "For instance, approximately 40% of genes in the Giardia genome have undergone gene duplication, with the majority of these involved in evading the host’s immune response (Sun et al. 2010"

### THE ORIGINS OF PARASITISM IN THE PROTISTS - J. R. Baker 1994
- "Although it seems clear that a free-living existence must have preceded parasitism as a life-style"
- apicomplexa became parasitic -> the got eaten by accident and got used to the life in ingestions tissues
- "There are three major routes by which an endoparasitic life-style could be achieved: inges- tion and subsequent adaptation of free-living forms, deeper penetration of ectoparasitic forms, and devel- opment through a facultatively parasitic phase to one of obligate parasitism. "
