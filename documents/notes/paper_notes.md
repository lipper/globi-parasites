## The Origins of Parasitism in the Platyhelminthes: a Summary Interpreted on the Basis of Recent Literature - Rohde 1997

## The evolution of parasitism in Nematoda - Blaxter 2014

## Synthesis of phylogeny and taxonomy into a comprehensive tree of life - Hinchliff 2015
- when phylogenetic data is missing, taxonomy was used
- first tree that is trying it
- We therefore as- sembled a comprehensive global reference taxonomy via align- ment and merging of multiple openly available taxonomic resources. The Open Tree Taxonomy (OTT) is open, extensible, and updatable, and reflects the overall phylogeny of life
- prefer taxonomies that matches the available phylogeny
- Phylogenies: 6,810 trees from 3,062
- Taxonomy: Fungorum + SILVA + NCBI + GBIF + IRMNG


## Global biotic interactions: An open infrastructure to share and analyze species-interaction datasets - Poelen 2014
- predictions of factors will impact an ecosystem
- "In our model, an interaction observation is figured as a specimen (or occurrence) that interacts with another specimen, using interaction terms from the OBO Relations Ontology (Smith et al., 2005)."
- extraordinary komplex datacomposition process
- "Spatial, temporal, and taxonomic coverage of the combined datasets (Fig. 4, Tables 1, 2) shows that the aggregation of the described data sources covers about 50,000 taxa (or 8% of total number of ITIS taxa) in a period from 1897 until the present. This coverage is larger than any other single open aggregated species-interaction data collection that is available today simply because it aggregates many of the current- ly available, large, open datasets (Table 1)"
- GoMexSI and EOL integrated GLoBI
- other interaction services: Efforts such as Ecologists' Cooper- ative Web Bank (Cohen and Ecologists co-operative web bank (ecoweb), 2010), Webs on the Web (Yoon et al., 2004), Animal Diver- sity Web (Myers et al., 2014), and Interaction Web Database (Vázquez, 2005) ---- not active anymore, old data

## Windsor 1998
- "Parasites are the true engines of evolution!"
- "Toft estimates that 14.5% of eukaryotic species are parasites"
- "May in 1998 recognised that parasites account for about half of the species on Earth"
- "May in 1992 he offered a ratio of four parasites for every free!living host"
- We are losing species very fast: Sprent JFA Parasites lost1992;22:139-151
